Manage your Woocommerce product categories easily with this flexible Category Tree plugin

== Description ==
With the Product Category Tree plugin, you can now manage your Woocommerce product categories in a tree structure.
This gives you a much better overview of your product categories – especially if you have a large amount of product categories with child categories.

The tree structure makes it easy to find the category you are searching for, as you simply expand and collapse the parent categories.

We have even added a drag ‘n’ drop functionality that makes it easy for you to change the order of your product categories. In quick edit you can add category image and change category parent.

* ‘Expand all’ and ‘Collapse all’ available
* Quick edit to change name and slug
* Quick edit to change category image.
